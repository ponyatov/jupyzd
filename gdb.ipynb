    "Modern [gdb](gdb.ipynb) versions have `--enable--python` option which included Python interpreter into the debugger for any target processor/MCU. This option looks me much better to embed [gdb](gdb.ipynb) interface into Jython, as we'll have a portable way to interact directly with hardware using any mainstream i/o interfaces like J-Link, ST-Link,.. or any UART/USB/ETH coupled with [gdb](gdb.ipynb) stub on the device."
